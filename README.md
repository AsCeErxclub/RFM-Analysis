# RFM-Analysis
üìù About the Project
This project demonstrates how to perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using Python to understand and categorize customer behavior. RFM is a powerful business analytics technique that helps in segmenting customers based on their past purchase patterns.

By applying this analysis, we can group customers into different categories, such as "Top Customers," "High-Value Customers," and "Lost Customers." This provides valuable insights that can be used to create more effective marketing strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## üìä What is RFM Analysis?
RFM is an acronym for three key metrics that provide a comprehensive view of customer behavior:

### RECENCY: 
How recently a customer made a purchase. The more recent the purchase, the more engaged the customer is considered to be.

### Frequency: 
How often a customer buys from you. Customers who make frequent purchases are generally considered more loyal.

### Monetary Value: 
How much a customer spends. High-spenders are typically the most valuable customers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
The Python implementation follows these key steps:

### Data Preparation: Read the dataset and convert the purchase dates to a usable datetime format.

### RFM Calculation: Calculate the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.

### Data Consolidation: Merge the calculated RFM metrics into a single DataFrame for a unified view.

### Customer Ranking & Scoring: Rank customers based on their RFM values and then normalize these ranks to a consistent scale. This is used to calculate a final RFM Score.

### Customer Segmentation: Classify customers into predefined segments (e.g., "Top Customers", "Lost Customers") based on their RFM scores.

### Visualization: Visualize the distribution of customer segments using a pie chart to easily understand the composition of the customer base.

## üöÄ Key Takeaways
This project provides a simple yet effective method for businesses to gain insights into customer behavior and plan their strategies accordingly. By focusing on customers who matter most, businesses can optimize their resources and drive better outcomes.
